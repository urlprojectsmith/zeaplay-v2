# Zea Play Project Status

Current: Phase 6.1 - PASS  
Next: Phase 6.2

This document is the compact handoff source of truth for future Codex sessions. Code and tests remain authoritative if this document ever disagrees with implementation.

Do not implement Phase 6 from this document alone. Use it to avoid rescanning completed Phase 1-5 work.

## Completed

### Phase 1 - PASS

Foundation / monorepo / infrastructure.

### Phase 2 - PASS

Authentication / security / JWT / refresh rotation / CSRF / RBAC / audit.

### Phase 3 - PASS

Assets / MinIO / presigned uploads/downloads / worker processing / quota.

### Phase 4 - PASS

Agency -> Workspace tenancy / memberships / scoped RBAC / feature entitlement foundation.

### Phase 5 - PASS

Design system / dashboard shells / Light-Dark-Colorful themes / protected frontend routing / responsive navigation / Agency-Workspace switching / white-label UI foundation / English-Tamil i18n / Storybook.

### Phase 6.1 - PASS

Workspace Users + Departments foundation.

Implemented:

- `/workspace/users` with paginated server-side workspace membership search, status/role/department filters, detail panel, role/status actions, and department assignment/removal.
- `/workspace/departments` with workspace-scoped department list, create/edit, activate/deactivate, manager assignment, member counts, and member visibility API.
- Workspace-scoped `/api/v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/users` and `/api/v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/departments` APIs.
- `Department` model plus optional `WorkspaceMembership.departmentId` assignment.
- Minimal stable permissions: `users.view`, `users.manage`, `departments.view`, `departments.create`, `departments.update`, `departments.manage_members`.

Security invariants:

- `x-agency-id` and `x-workspace-id` must agree with route params through the existing workspace tenant guard.
- Workspace membership mutations are scoped by `(userId, workspaceId)`.
- Foreign department assignment and foreign manager assignment are rejected.
- Workspace OWNER membership cannot be changed through Phase 6.1 user actions.
- Suspended memberships remain blocked by tenant resolution.

Known limitations:

- User identity creation/invitation, final Agency/Super Admin user management, and custom role management remain deferred.
- Department hierarchy/nesting and many-to-many department membership are intentionally not implemented.

## Architecture Invariants

- PostgreSQL is source of truth.
- Agency -> Workspace is active tenant hierarchy.
- Workspace is operational data boundary.
- Backend tenant authorization is authoritative.
- Access token remains memory-only.
- Refresh token remains HttpOnly.
- CSRF protection remains enabled.
- `x-agency-id` and `x-workspace-id` are centralized.
- OWNER wildcards never cross tenant boundaries.
- MinIO credentials never reach browser.
- External work must eventually use queue/adapter architecture.
- Redis is not source of truth.
- Existing cross-tenant attack tests must remain passing.
- Phase 1-5 passing functionality must not be casually rewritten.

## Current Database Tenant Model

- Agency
- Workspace
- AgencyMembership
- WorkspaceMembership
- Department
- Role
- Permission
- FeatureDefinition / FeatureEntitlement
- Project
- Asset
- ProcessingJob
- AuditLog

Do not infer or invent model fields from this list.

## Known Deferred Items

- Magic-byte asset inspection.
- Stale pending upload cleanup.
- Production Docker digest pinning.
- Next ESLint detection warning.
- `allowedDevOrigins` warning.
- Final Developer/Super Admin backend authorization.
- Final white-label backend.
- PWA.
- Business modules not yet implemented.

## Current Warnings

Confirmed current warnings:

- Next build reports: "The Next.js plugin was not detected in your ESLint configuration."
- `BrandLogo.tsx` uses `<img>` for arbitrary white-label logo URLs, producing the Next `@next/next/no-img-element` warning.
- Playwright/Next dev server reports future `allowedDevOrigins` configuration warning for `127.0.0.1` cross-origin `/_next/*` assets.
- Storybook build reports upstream Storybook/Rolldown direct `eval` warnings and chunk-size warnings.
- `pnpm audit --audit-level high` passes, while reporting 1 moderate vulnerability.

## Handoff Notes

- Phase 5 acceptance passed with formatting, lint, typecheck, unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests, production build, high-threshold audit, and Storybook build.
- Phase 6.1 acceptance passed with formatting, lint, typecheck, unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests, production build, Prisma validation, and high-threshold audit.
- E2E auth uses real protected frontend routing with mocked API responses; the previous dev-only frontend session bypass was removed.
- Future phases should extend from the existing tenant, auth, dashboard shell, theme, i18n, queue, and storage boundaries instead of replacing them.
